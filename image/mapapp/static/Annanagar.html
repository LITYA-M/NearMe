 Anna Nagar Tower Park
The Anna Nagar Tower is a 138 feet (42 m) tall tower built for the 1968 World Trade Fair, by B. S. Abdur Rahman.<br> Its main entrance is from the 3rd Main Road and a back entrance from the 6th main road. <br>It is popular with morning walkers and joggers, and with families and young people in the evenings to play and relax.<br> For a nominal fee, one could walk to the top of the tower from where excellent views of the city could be seen.<br> Entry inside the tower has been stopped for the last few years due to safety concerns as there had been a few cases of suicide in the past.<br> The tower and park are now renovated and has a skating rink.<br> Currently, it boasts of a good turnout of children who come in for practising their skills on roller skates.<br> There is also a group of regulars who practice silambattam – an ancient Tamil martial art form – here.<br> From atop the tower one can have a panoramic views, and the rapidly changing skyline of the city can be appreciated..</p>
